# SPA rendering

A demo idea of how to efficiently render a SPA app.

See this live demo here: https://react-spa-rendering.pages.dev/

Requirements:
* Authentication
* User permissions (authorisation)
* Feature flags (still to do)
* Routing between pages
* Different routers (depending on user "role")
